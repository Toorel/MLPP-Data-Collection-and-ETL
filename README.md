# MLPP-Data-Collection-and-ETL

I used the public API that was provided by the Census Bureau. It was straightforward and instructions were provided on how to use it. Using the API, I used Washington DC and pull demographic data about data profiles that pertained to social characteristics of households. For my code, I took input from the API and transformed it into a dataframe for easy manipulation.
